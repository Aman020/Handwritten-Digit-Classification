# SupervisedLearning

This project is to implement machine learning methods for the task of classification. We have to train the model using 4 different classifiers. The classification task is basically to recognize a 28Ã—28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. We have to use MNIST dataset to train the model. Following are the 4 different classifiers that we are going to use for training the model on MNIST dataset.
1. Logistic regression, which will be implemented using backpropagation and the model is trained by tuning hyper parameters.
2. A multilayer perceptron neural network,train i ton the MNIST digit images and by tune hyper parameters.
3. A Random Forest classifier that will be trained on the MNIST digit images.
4. A SVM classifier to be trained on the MNIST digit images.
